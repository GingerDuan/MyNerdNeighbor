# My Nerd Neighbor


book tracker | book sharing | nerd networking | neighborhood library

When visit to your neighbor's house, you look around and take a look at their bookshelf. 
In that moment you might know more about your neighbor more about their reading taste and personality.
My Nerd Neighbor is a book tracker and a book-sharing platform based in the community. 
Users can find any book in this app or create a new book and put it on shelves and make the reivew.
The user's profile page will show the user's virtual bookshelf including books I own,  want to read, am reading, and have finished. 
On the book's detail page, any user's record will be shown and differentiated from the user's own, neighbor's, and other user's by color. 
The community page is the last part of this app and allows the user to know what's your neighbor's reading updating. 
The neighborhood library will show the neighbor's book available to loan, you can also search for a book in the same zip code as you.
In the future, I will add more social features and turn MNN into a social media based on the online reading community and local community.
